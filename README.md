# mini-scripts

Hello and welcome to the mini-scripts repo! Mini-scripts is a collection of scripts I wrote for CTF competitions, lab exercises, and coding challenges.

If you have any CTFs to suggest or excercises you think are worth trying, reach out!

## Coding Challenges

- [Substitution Cipher Implemented in C++](mini-scripts/coding_challenges/substitution_cipher)

## CTF Scripts

- [PortSwigger's Blind SQL Injection Labs](mini-scripts/ctf_scripts/blind_sql_injection)
- [Hardened Host File Exfiltration](mini-scripts/ctf_scripts/file_transfers) (**NOT WRITTEN BY ME**)
